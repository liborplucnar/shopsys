# Required PHP Configuration

This is a recommended configuration of PHP for project development using Shopsys Platform.

## Recommended `php.ini` settings

```
; do not recognize code between '<?' and '?>' tags as PHP source
short_open_tag = Off

; some development CLI commands can be memory consuming
memory_limit = 512M

; enables upload of files up to 32 MB
post_max_size = 32M
upload_max_filesize = 32M

; report all errors in development environment
error_reporting = E_ALL

; for better performance of Symfony applications especially on Windows
; source: https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/performance.html
realpath_cache_size = 4096k
realpath_cache_ttl = 600

; enable OpCache (otherwise Symfony will be slow)
opcache.enable=1

; faster mechanism for calling the deconstructors in your code at the end of a single request
opcache.fast_shutdown = true

; The amount of memory used to store interned strings, in megabytes
opcache.interned_strings_buffer = 24

; Optimizations for Symfony, as documented on https://symfony.com/doc/5.4/performance.html
opcache.max_accelerated_files = 60000

; The size of the shared memory storage used by OPcache, in megabytes
opcache.memory_consuption = 256

; always resolve symlinks
opcache.revalidate_path=1

; how often to check script timestamps for updates. 0 will result in opcache checking
; for updates on every request. Recommended value for production is 300
opcache.revalidate_freq = 0

; use absolute paths, so that there are not collision for files with same names
opcache.use_cwd=1
```
