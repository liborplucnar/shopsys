#### promo code for free transport and payment ([#3625](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3625))

- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Order\PromoCode\PromoCode::$discountType` is now a string instead of an integer
    - check `Version20241126152128` migration whether it suits your needs
    - `PromoCode::DISCOUNT_TYPE_PERCENT` and `PromoCode::DISCOUNT_TYPE_NOMINAL` constants were removed, use the constants defined in `PromoCodeTypeEnum` instead
- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Order\Order` has a new attribute `$freeTransportAndPaymentApplied` that contains information about whether the order has free transport and payment applied (either via reaching limit or via applying the promo code)
    - check `Version20241128111224` migration whether it suits your needs - it sets the attribute to `false` for all existing orders
- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\PaymentPriceCalculation::isFree()` method was removed, use `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\TransportAndPayment\FreeTransportAndPaymentFacade::isFree()` instead
- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Transport\TransportPriceCalculation::isFree()` method was removed, use `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\TransportAndPayment\FreeTransportAndPaymentFacade::isFree()` instead
- frontend API: `Cart.promoCode` changed its type from string to `PromoCode` object (consisting of string `code` and string `type` properties)
