#### Fix preselecting packetery with empty pickup point ([#3663](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3663))

- when we unselect transport or clear a persist store, we lose the previously selected pickup point of packetery transport
- now we check the correctness of data before preselecting packetery transport with corrupted pickup point
- in case of incomplete info, the error is thrown and then caught in `loadTransportAndPaymentFromLastOrder` just to skip the `changeTransportInCart` and the rest of preselecting of transport and payment from last order
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
