#### improve rendering of the eshop required settings ([#3658](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3658))

- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Admin\DefaultController`
    - method `addWarningMessagesOnDashboard()` was removed
    - method `checkEnabledMailTemplatesHaveTheirBodyAndSubjectFilled()` was removed
    - method `checkAtLeastOneUnitExists()` was removed
    - method `checkDefaultUnitIsSet()` was removed
    - method `checkMandatoryArticlesExist()` was removed
    - method `checkAllSliderNumericValuesAreSet()` was removed
- use new class `RequiredSettingExtension` instead of removed methods
- the required settings are now rendered in the `layoutWithPanel.html.twig` template by calling the `render_required_settings()` function instead of inside the flash message
- translations for the required settings have changed, check if you need to update your custom translations
