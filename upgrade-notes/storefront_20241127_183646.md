#### Added mappers for Convertim payment and transport types ([#3624](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3624))

- `transports` query and `transports::payments` now have optional argument `displayInCartOnly: bool` that currently filters out Convertim payment and transport types, but can be in future be used for other purposes
- `PaymentTypeEnum` in `types/payment.ts` was replaced by `TypePaymentTypeEnum` which is now fetched from API as part of any `Payment` query
- new `displayInCartOnly: false` variable option is used for `useTransportsWithStoresQuery` in `Convertim.tsx`
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
